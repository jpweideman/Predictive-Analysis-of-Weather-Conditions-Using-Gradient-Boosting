# PREDICTIVE-ANALYSIS-OF-WEATHER-CONDITIONS-USING-GRADIENT-BOOSTING

## Overview

This project conducts a **predictive analysis of weather conditions** for the city of Szeged, Hungary, using a decade’s worth of hourly meteorological data (2006–2016). The primary goal is to develop and optimize **Gradient Boosting models** for predicting:
1. **Temperature**
2. **Apparent Temperature**

This include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis.

- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing or anomalous values using methods like Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into variable relationships and patterns, including annual temperature cycles and correlations.
- **Gradient Boosting Models:**
  - Separate models for **Temperature** and **Apparent Temperature**.
  - Grid search for hyperparameter optimization.
  - Cross-validation to assess and improve model performance.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifying and interpreting the most influential variables for predictions.

## Project Files

- `Data_cleaning.r`: Script for cleaning the dataset and preparing it for analysis.
